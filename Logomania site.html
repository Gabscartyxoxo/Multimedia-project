<!--Next is a link to the cascading style sheet or CSS. Web designers use a cascading stylesheet CSS to add styling to a website. Designers do this by "calling" a <div class> in HTML and defining the class attributes on the style sheet. Doing so saves time and results in less code. On the style.css page you'll find attributes relating font, text size, image size, among other details.-->

    <!--Designers refer to this next section as a "Hero Image." The hero image is styled on the style.css page by calling a "class." To replace the hero image, simply place a .jpg file in the same file folder (directory) as this project and name it "hero.jpg." Alternatively, if you are working with a .png, you will need to open the style.css file using your text editor, find the "hero-image" class and change the file type from ".jpg" to ".png."" Browsers will only work with .jpg, .jpeg, or .png images. Since hero images need to stretch across the screen, typically you will want to select an image 1200px in width to allow quick load time yet avoid pixilation.-->

          <h2>Where did the trend come from?</h2>
          <h3>Logomania also known as Monogram print is still very prevalent in the world of fashion today. Logomania originally stems from the 80's and is/was designed to allude to wealth as well as status. This style also shows itself in knock offs, luxury goods, and fashion's use as a comodity in the 1990s. Lots of brands will shorten their names into intials to print all over clothing and accesories as demonstrated in the image above of the designer Louis Vuitton.</h3>
          <h2>Who Popularized it?</h2>
          <h3>This is another style popularized by African Americans which would them become a staple in our culture. As stated before, Logomania became extremely popular in the 1990s and a lot of that is due to the credit of the growing hip hop culture. Many people believe the King/founder of Logomania was 'Dapper Dan', a pioneer of streetwear. In the 1980s Dapper Dan created his own clothing boutique where he printed big name brands (Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Prada) in cutting new edge ways that other brands hadn't yet thought of. He gained a lot of support from major stars like P Diddy, Floyd Mayweather, Jay Z, LL Cool J, Snoop Dogg, and Tupac. </h3>
          <h2>What does Logomania look like today?</h2>
          <h3>Though Logomania isn't nearly as popular as it was in the 1980s and 1990s, it still is worn. Especially in current times of a recession and financial crisis minimalism tends to overtake the catwalk these days.</h3>
