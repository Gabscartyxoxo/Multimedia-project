<!--Next is a link to the cascading style sheet or CSS. Web designers use a cascading stylesheet CSS to add styling to a website. Designers do this by "calling" a <div class> in HTML and defining the class attributes on the style sheet. Doing so saves time and results in less code. On the style.css page you'll find attributes relating font, text size, image size, among other details.-->

    <!--Designers refer to this next section as a "Hero Image." The hero image is styled on the style.css page by calling a "class." To replace the hero image, simply place a .jpg file in the same file folder (directory) as this project and name it "hero.jpg." Alternatively, if you are working with a .png, you will need to open the style.css file using your text editor, find the "hero-image" class and change the file type from ".jpg" to ".png."" Browsers will only work with .jpg, .jpeg, or .png images. Since hero images need to stretch across the screen, typically you will want to select an image 1200px in width to allow quick load time yet avoid pixilation.-->

          <h2>Where did the trend come from?</h2>
          <h3> Sneaker culture refers to collecting shoes old and new. Brands include but arent limited to: Puma, Nike, Adidas, Converse, Air Jordans, New Balance, Reebok, Vans, and Timberlands. This trend emerged in the 1970s, originally in sports culture and then went mainstream as a form of cultural expression. Sneaker Head culture would continue to gain popularity after the premiere of 'Air Jordan' shoe line introduced in 1985. </h3>
          <h2>Who Popularized it?</h2>
          <h3>The shoes would be mostly worn by children/teenagers of color which would then prompt them to become sneaker collectors as an indicator of wealth as well as creativity. By the end of the 90s trend things like swap parties and vintage shops would pop up everywhere in the persuit of collectables and deadstock items. Though black youth popularized shoe collecting, Sneaker Head culture would also become really popular in Asian countries. </h3>
          <h2>What does Sneaker Culture look like today?</h2>
          <h3>Sneaker Head culture remains extremely popular today as it's still an integral part of Streetwear. In the last decade, streetwear as a whole has been revolutionized by working with higher designers to create luxury pieces. </h3>
