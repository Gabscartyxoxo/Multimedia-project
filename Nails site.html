<!--Next is a link to the cascading style sheet or CSS. Web designers use a cascading stylesheet CSS to add styling to a website. Designers do this by "calling" a <div class> in HTML and defining the class attributes on the style sheet. Doing so saves time and results in less code. On the style.css page you'll find attributes relating font, text size, image size, among other details.-->

    <!--Designers refer to this next section as a "Hero Image." The hero image is styled on the style.css page by calling a "class." To replace the hero image, simply place a .jpg file in the same file folder (directory) as this project and name it "hero.jpg." Alternatively, if you are working with a .png, you will need to open the style.css file using your text editor, find the "hero-image" class and change the file type from ".jpg" to ".png."" Browsers will only work with .jpg, .jpeg, or .png images. Since hero images need to stretch across the screen, typically you will want to select an image 1200px in width to allow quick load time yet avoid pixilation.-->

          <h2>Where did the trend come from?</h2>
          <h3> Nail decore has been a sign of wealth since as far back as Ancient Egypt indicating that the women who were them did not partake in manual labor.Arcylic nails would emerge in the 1950s after being created by a dentist, Maxwell Lappe. Arylics were quickly picked up by black women as a reflection of femininity and style. Donyale Luna, the first Black woman on the cover of Vogue in 1966, was sporting acrylics.</h3>
          <h2>Who Popularized it?</h2>
          <h3>Black women are heaily responsible for the popularization of Acrylic nails. After being worn by the first black woman on vogue, other celebrities like Donna Summer, Diana Ross, and Flo Jo (pictured) wore long colorful nails. </h3>
          <h2>What do acrylics look like today?</h2>
          <h3>Acrylic nails remain extremely popular among a variety of audiences. Though in the 1970s and 80s, many white people sneered at acrylic nails, disregarding them as a sign of low class, these days men and women of all ages and cultures wear them. </h3>
